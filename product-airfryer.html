					<h1 class="subtitle">An inclusive design for users with visual impairment (PBLV)</h1>
					<p class="concept">This project focused on understanding the usability of the Philips Airfryer 5000 XXL  during the cooking experience for visual impaired people. The goal is to gather insights through usability test and observations to them translate them into recommendations and guidelines for a more inclusive redesign of the current Philips product and app.</p>

					<p class="brief"> 
						The project focused on investigating the user experience of an airfryer for the young population, 
						between 15-20 years old, who have a visual impairment (PBLV). The two stakeholders, Visio and Versuni, 
						are interested in gaining knowledge on how to guarantee the inclusivity of the product for PBLV and how 
						they can effectively facilitate co-design sessions with the target users for their further projects.  
						<a href="https://www.visio.org/home/visio-international/" target="_blank">Visio</a> is an NGO supporting PBLV and Versuni <a href="https://www.versuni.com/" target="_blank">Versuni</a> is a company developing diverse products, like an airfryer and a 
						mobile app Phillips NutriU.

					<p class="text"><em>How do people with visual impairments generally cook? How do they experience the whole process starting from the grocery shopping to the preparation of the ingredients? </em> <br>
					To answer to this question the team with the support of the stakeholders and a visual impaired tutor simulated the conditions of the target user cooking with the airfryer, as well as doing groceries. This was done with the use of VR glasses showing the world from the PBLVs perspectives. We went through the entire journey to prepare a meal- grocery shopping, preparing the meal, and cooking with the airfryer. The data from this simulation was collected by taking videos, pictures and notes during the session.

					<p class="text"><em>How do the design of the chosen product, Philips airfryer XXL, and other competitors differ? </em><br>
					The benchmarking between comparable products on the market we can conclude that the Philips 5000 Series XXL offers a comprehensive digital experience with extensive cooking options and Nutri-app integration. The Philips HD9252/70 also provides digital controls and multiple cooking options but lacks the Nutri-app functionality. The Electrolux EAF50, with its analog interface and limited information provided, may offer a simpler experience but lacks advanced features like digital controls and app integration.

					<p class="text"></em>How do people from 15 to 20 years with visual impairments experience the airfryer? Do they already know how to use an Airfryer? What are their suggestions and wishes? What hinders them from using the airfryer or promotes them to use the product in the long run? </em><br>
					A cooking session was conducted with four users ranging in age from 16 to 18. They have been divided into two teams one assigned with a analogic airfryer and the second one with the Philips airfrier 5000 XL into analysis. The same recipe was performed by the two teams and to fallow a cognitive walkthrough tool place after the cooking session.

			<h2 class="section-title">Main Insights</h2>
			<div class="section-content">
				<div class="insights-details1">
					<p class="text">Insights about having a visual impairment
					<ul>
						<li>Your brain builds a mental model of the controls. It is like a road map, knowing exactly what steps you need to take in order to reach the end goal, for example turning on the Airfryer at 200 degrees for 5 minutes.</li>
						<li>PBLV perform many actions from memory, making the first interaction with a new product/store is the hardest because they have not been able to create the mental model of the controls yet.</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="text">Insights from a NON-blind person 
						<ul>
							<li>The touchscreen is pretty intuitive and easy to use.</li>
							<li>The pre-sets provided by the device are not really useful, they do not get selected often but instead, the users prefer to select the temperature and the timers themself. 
								This is caused by the overwhelming list of possibilities, not knowing exactly 
								what would match closest to the recipe and ease of selecting the temperature and time.</li>
							<li>It is very easy to burn yourself while taking out food by touching the inside of the airfryer basket.</li>
							<li>Improvised recipes are hard: you do not know what works, how long it takes to cook. For a NON-blind user, this limitation can be easily 
								overcome by looking at the exterior aspect of the food. But for a PBLV, this is not possible. How would users feel if it is ready? This requires help.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p class="text">Insights about youngsters (aged 15-20) 
						<ul>
							<li>Young users are often assisted by family members at home, not only to speed up the cooking process but 
								also because parents worry they might injure themselves in the kitchen. While this support is valuable, 
								it can also have a downside: it may hinder the development of the youngsters’ independence. An air fryer 
								could offer a practical solution, empowering them to cook safely on their own while also giving parents 
								the reassurance and sense of trust they need.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					
					<p class="text">Insights about touch screen interaction and tactile experience 
						<ul>
							<li>Using hands is important for users. The very first interaction is touching/stroking the entire device all around to know the context.</li>
							<li>The biggest problem is providing enough orientation and context on the thouch screen as the need to memories the button placement on the screen with few reference point. 
								An analog airfryer instead can help a lot of the users to orient themselves in the space</li>
							<li>Reading the screen with low vision is challenging; more cooking time is expected.</li>
							<li>The icons are not clearly visible, which makes it hard to understand what you are doing and what you have to do next</li>
							<li>Users have problems with repeated multi-touch interactions (e.g., multi-split-tapping).</li>
							<li>Burning themself is the scariest thing for PBLV. They need sensibility in their hands and fingers. 
								When the basket is not inserted, there is nothing that prevents them from inserting their hands inside the hot airfryer.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>

					<p class="text"> Insights about device feedback
						<ul>
							<li>The clicking feedback when the basket is closed correctly is really helpful for PBLV.</li>
							<li>The "Beeping sound effect" for time adjustment helped the PBLV.</li>
							<li>In a crowded kitchen it is really hard to hear the feedback noises from the airfryer. To prevent this the PBLV tend to set the timer on their phone. They rely a lot on the time suggested by the recipe for making sure that the food is well cooked.</li>
							<li>Sound is a must; it gives confirmation to their actions so that the PBLV can continue the same behaviour (for example adjusting the temperature). However, the monotone sounds do not show a difference between different buttons. </li>
						</ul>
					</p>

					<p class="text"> Insights about application
						<ul>
							<li>The target group is very confident and open about the use of technological devices to support them in accomplishing tasks (Smart vocal assistants, applications, et cetera).</li>
							
						</ul>
					</p>

					<p class="text"> Insights about retrieving the food from the airfryer
						<ul>
							<li>The inside of the airfryer is really hot and can be dangerous</li>
							<li>The inside basket must be fully tilted to get rid of all the food inside (but it is a bit hard to detect).</li>
							<li>Taking out the food from the airfryer can be hard because the gripper button is not easy to spot (even harder if they are wearing kitchen gloves).</li>
							<li>They use kitchen gloves while extracting the basket from the airfryer, this helps them to prevent burning themself but at the same time lowers their ability to feel the buttons  et cetera</li>
							<li>Inserting the tray in a traditional oven is much more complicated, the airfryer simplifies this phase.</li>
							
						</ul>

			<div class="section-content">
				<div class="frominsighttoreccomandation-details1">

					<p class="text"> Enhancing user experience
						<ul>
						<li>Designing for inclusivity does not solely involve catering to the more vulnerable user groups; it also contributes to improving the overall experience for all other users of the product.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p class="text"> User-centric Design
						<ul>
						<li>The design does not have to be excessively protective when it comes to the target group. It is acceptable for users to make mistakes. Instead, the design should offer an accessible and intuitive approach for users to address the challenges they encounter.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					
					<p class="text"> Sensory inclusive design
						<ul>
						<li>Feedback and feedforward are crucial aspects to consider when designing for inclusivity. They should not only be appropriate and aligned with the intended message for the user but also engage multiple levels of perception at the same moment. (for example by combining haptic feedback and sounds.)
							Furthermore, they should not only be audible and haptic but also allows for adjustability in volume, frequency, et cetera.<br></li>
						</li>
						</ul>
					</p>

					<p class="text"> Sound effect
						<ul>
						<li>Have more obvious, intuitive sound effects; for example changing sound notes, volume, etc. Both the digital sound and physical sound from the device matter.<br></li>
						</li>
						</ul>
					</p>

					<p class="text"> Gamification
						<ul>
						<li>Have more obvious, intuitive sound effects; for example changing sound notes, volume, etc. Both the digital sound and physical sound from the device matter.<br></li>
						</li>
						</ul>
					</p>

					<p class="text"> Cooking preferences
						<ul>
						<li>The app could support the use of the Philips Airfryer 5000 XXL by saving the user cooking preferences (such as time and temperature)<br></li>
						</li>
						</ul>
					</p>

					<p class="text"> Extra feedback
						<ul>
						<li>The app could be used as an extra source of feedback. The airfryer could send a notification on the user's phone when the food is ready (acting as a timer).<br></li>
						</li>
						</ul>
					</p>

					<p class="text"> Add-on
						<ul>
						<li>This implies that making the basic functions of the device work properly should be the priority. We should not expect to fix a poor design with a good app, the app should only act as an add-on and never as a replacement.<br></li>
						</li>
						</ul>
					</p>

					<p class="text"> Gestural interaction
						<ul>
						<li>Keep the gestural interaction as simple as possible (tapping once!).<br></li>
						</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
