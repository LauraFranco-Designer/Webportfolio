					<h1 class="subtitle">A speculative approach to vegetable voice and rights</h1>
					<p class="concept"> We grow plants to make our house pretty or to get vegetables and fruit from them, in anyway we are using them to fulfill our needs.
 With a speculative approach, this project aims to amplify vegetables’ voices and show how they could express their feelings in a way that humans could perceive. 
The concept wants to achieve this by switching the relationship human-plant by making the human the servant of the vegetables and not the opposite, as we are normally used to. 
The lights with different colors and the sounds from the capsules will express the emotion of the vegetables and the status of their communication. Humans will learn how to understand the “vegetable 
language”, and they will be able to amplify the plant’s voice, through the use of the megaphone, but not all the communications will be understandable for people. Some sound will only be plant-to-plant 
“private communication”. This conveys the message that not everything and not all communications is about human.</p>

					How can we use state-of-the-art technologies to find smarter and more efficient approaches to food? <a href="https://www.braunhousehold.com/en" target="_blank">Braun</a> is interested in how kitchens and cooking habits might change by 2030 to make better use of food resources, join in circular systems and local products as well as make life easier, more convenient, 
and less wasteful for the home cook. The designs should be aimed at home kitchens and home cooks but can target any part of the food production, growing, planning, preparation, cooking, eating, and 
cleaning process.

					<p class="text"> The design process of this project doesnt start with the research phase to lead to the development of a concept but instead begins hands on in the technology to create opportunity to create rapid prototype redi to test and evaluate. The fast paste concept variation followed prototping and testing lear to the exploration to different teclologies "learning by doing". The illustration below, visualize the iterative process used during the project, 
where the various loop represents the numerous cycles through which the final design and concept has been defined and further developed.

					<p class="text">  The final exhibition provided a valuable opportunity to showcase the project to the client, Braun, while also gathering key insights for future development. The exhibition space was designed to evoke a dark, futuristic atmosphere, enhancing the presence of both the capsule and the plants. No descriptions or explanations were provided to visitors, encouraging them to immerse themselves in the environment and discover how to interact with the plants on their own. Through brief conversations, we gained insight into their experiences and emotions. This approach allowed us to assess the intuitiveness of the design while also giving visitors time to reflect on a topic that is often overlooked. </p>
