					<h2 class="title">Redesign Philips Avent Baby Monitor</h2>
					<h1 class="subtitle">An intergation of medical features for baby care</h1>
					<p class="concept">The redesign optimizes and simplifies the light indicator on the parent and camera unit through the use of light strips on top of the units. The animations and colors of the light allow users to understand the status from a 
						distance all around. The lighten-up buttons give clear feedback on the input. The onboarding screen with a pre-setup simplifies the button interaction to operate the main functions. The concept offers a 
						portable parent unit to make it an extension of the user. The improved sensor of the camera unit collects more health-related data. It can be installed flexibly with the magnet stand to secure an optimized 
						angle. The user can track the changes in the sleeping pattern in the app on the smartphone. In addition, also the unboxing phase has been thought through by redesigning the packaging to facilitate the device setup

						The objective of this project is the redesign of the Philips Avent Baby Monitor which is part of the Philips product portfolio in order to improve the usability of it and the parents' experience of use. The redesign also integrate additional medical features 
which were not designed in the original Philips device

					<ul class="tasks-list">				
						<li class="tasks">
							<h3 class="task-title">First-hand experience</h3>
							<p class="description">The first observation was done by one of the team members who hadn’t used the 
								product before and observed by the others. The observation started by opening the box 
								and then some scenarios which were organized in a way to cover the entire flow of the 
								interaction with the system, from the unboxing to the connection and the setup of the 
								different devices</p>
						</li>
						<li class="tasks">
							<h3 class="task-title">Analysis of the reviews</h3>
							<p class="description">Current users speak up about their opinion of the product in online forums and product 
								review sections. They mostly describe their views and the impact of the product on their 
								life. The team summarizes the main takeaways from reviews from Amazon and Philip’s 
								online shop by taking into consideration the limitation in terms of objectivity of this step.</p>
						</li>
						<li class="tasks">
							<h3 class="task-title">Compact Field Study</h3>
							<p class="description">The research method used was a survey. The participants were parents (n=7) who already 
								used some sort of baby monitor. We targeted users who had a baby at the moment of 
								filling it in or had babies 3-4 years old. This way all the participants had fresh experiences 
								with the baby monitors. These parents all fit the targeted age group. The participants 
								were gathered through personal connections. The aim was to gather data about various 
								baby monitors’ positive and negative sides and have a better overview of the context and 
								the users.</p>
						</li>
						<li class="tasks">
							<h3 class="task-title">Usability Inspection</h3>
							<p class="description">Both cognitive walkthrough and heuristic evaluation are conducted in order to gain the 
								last bit of understanding of the product and to start testing afterward. The cognitive 
								walkthrough, which was conducted with one team member (n=1), acted as a good 
								starting point to freely identify elements to analyze before testing them out with real 
								users. It helped the team understand how the actual user tests need to be set up.
								For the heuristic evaluation, the team selected 6 of the 10 Jakob Nielsen’s Heuristic 
								Evaluations. These turned out to be most relevant for the evaluation because they focus 
								on product feedback and control.</p>
						</li>
						<li class="tasks">
							<h3 class="task-title">User Tests</h3>
							<p class="description">Based on the insights gathered from the previous activities, a user test is conducted 
								with five mothers to analyze the monitor in the real context and understand the current 
								problems the intended user has. Besides that, the team set scenarios for the user to 
								observe how they behave with the product and what their experiences are while using 
								the product. With these findings, the team could compare the evaluation and frame the 
								problem for this project</p>

			<h2 class="section-title">Medical features integration</h2>
			<div class="section-content">
				<div class="prototype-details1">
					<p class="text">Regarding the medical features integrated into the device, the team mapped a broad overview of the competitors. In this way it was possible to define the market hole in which the Philips Avent Baby 
						Monitor was supposed to be placed. The interview with the parents and some literature reviews in this field made it clear that this part would have played a delicate role in the overall redesign. Parents 
						want to know that the baby is healthy but an excessive awareness about the baby’s parameters could instead cause stress and anxiety in the parents. Another essential aspect we considered is whether the 
						sensors should be attached to the baby’s diaper/clothes. As shown by research, parents tend to prefer devices that do not come into close contact with children. The team’s vision is to refrain from adding 
						a new element to the baby monitor. This means that we kept the camera and the parent unit and we only add features and not extra physical element. The new feature will be added to the camera to track 
						the baby and inform the parent through the parent unit. Philips should not be seen as a cure, but only as a resource for tracking the baby’s health.</p>	
					<img src="risorse/baby_medical1.png" class="prototype-image1">				
					<p class="text">The app performs the same functions as the parent unit but has the advantage that can be carried around more easily even outside of the 
						house. In addition to this, the main difference between the app and the monitor is that the app has an entire section dedicated to the baby’s 
						health called “Analytics”. In this section, the parents or who is taking care of the baby won’t be able to control the features such as talk back, 
						night light, etc. The camera view in this section will not disappear but will be more compact to give space to the medical menu: 
						- live breath control, 
						- sleep tracking, 
						- baby’s temperature, 
						- motion tracking.
						In each section, it is possible to view the live data, an overview of the day and the night, and the data history of the previous days so that the 
						user can keep track of the parameters</p>

				<div class="exhibition-details1">
					<p class="text">The team wanted to make it easy for the parents to check the status of the baby. With the current design is not possible to read the screen from a far distance (ex. opposite side of the room) so with the 
						redesign, we implemented the lights on the parent’s unit to make it visible from every direction. Also, the camera unit now has a strip light on the top. We simplifyed the multiple light indicators into one, the 
						colors and animations of the light deliver the system’s status. The strip on the camera unit also performs as the night light, and the unit is made more compact by saving space for the lamp</p>
					<img src="risorse/Light feedback system.png" alt="exhibition section" class="exhibition-image">

					<p class="text">Three buttons are located on the top-right corner of the parent unit to be easily approachable. 
						They are used as ‘Hot keys’ to operate functions within one click. With the half-transparent material, 
						they are lightened up to give suggestions or indicate the active status. 
						This gives the user more confidence while using the monitor and feeling in control.</p>
					<img src="risorse/buttons system.png" alt="exhibition section" class="exhibition-image">

					<p class="text">The clip-on on the back of the monitor gives the user the possibility to wear the monitor on their 
						clothes. The clip-on will make the monitor more reliable because the user can keep it close at all 
						times while still being ergonomic.</p>

						knows the differences and knows which adapter goes with 
						which component.
						With the use of the NFC logo, the user is guided to put the 
						phone on this spot. While taking out the 2 compartments 
						a slot of the size of a phone will also appear and invite the 
						user to place the phone on the NFC reader, which will guide 
						the smartphone to the download page. In this way the user 
						is notified about the existence of the app immediately after 
						the purchase</p>
