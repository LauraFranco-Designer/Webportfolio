					<h1 class="subtitle">Regained Mobility, Smart Solutions for Rehabilitation</h1>
					<p class="concept">  Remo project is driven by two key research areas: enhancing the patient experience through an intuitive application and redesign of the wearable device to address usability challenges identified in the product. Our goal is to create a seamless, guided interaction for users while improving the bracelet and sensor for better comfort, usability, and durability.

					Beyond usability, we are designing with sustainability in mind, developing components that are not only user-friendly but also easily separable at the product’s end of life.</p>

					<p class="brief"> 

					This project is the result of the bachelor final project, developed in collaboration with <a href="https://www.morecognition.com/en/" target="_blank">Morecognition S.r.l.</a> a pioneering spin-off supported by the <a href="https://www.iit.it/en-US/" target="_blank">Italian Institute of Technology (IIT)</a>. Morecognition translates clinical research into innovative rehabilitation and ICT solutions, aiming to improve health and well-being during the aging process. <br> 

					The start-up is developing "Remo", a sensor-equipped device that records muscle electrical impulses to assist patients with limb paralysis or dysfunction during rehabilitation. By enabling data sharing between patients and medical professionals, Remo enhances personalized care. <br> 

					Morecognition’s goal was to redesign the device to improve its functionality and prepare it for market launch.</p>

					<p class="text"> Remo acts as a mediator in the dialogue between the patient and the physiotherapist but also as a supporter and motivator for the user when practicing the physiotherapy exercises</p>

					<img src="risorse/remo_system.png" alt="Research section" class="research-image_system">

					<p class="text"> Remo's goal is to create a rehabilitation journey that meets the needs of users, particularly the elderly, who would otherwise have difficulty traveling to the clinic for every physiotherapy session. This device represents a real opportunity to maintain a constant and sustainable rehabilitation program, allowing the patient to perform exercises comfortably at home. At the same time, Remo ensures effective supervision by the physiotherapist, providing adequate support throughout the recovery process.</p>
