					<h1 class="subtitle">A research on human-phone interaction</h1>
					<p class="concept">Most of the people in the city center tend to use their phones when they move around. Some of them use it actively for calls, texts, socials, and directions; 
						others hold it in their hand, just in case they will need it because they feel awkward or under social pressure. The phone creates an immersive bubble that muffles people’s awareness about the surrounding 
						environment. An excessive detachment from the world around them can create potentially dangerous situations both for the phone’s users and for the people around them. Because of the phone, our body 
						language gets misinterpreted, making people around us confused on in which direction we are going to make our next step. The design aims to create more balance between pedestrians while using their phones, by making them more 
						aware of their surroundings and less focused on the task on the phone.

					<p class="brief"> 
						This project explores the dynamics that arise from everyday interactions between people, objects, and services. Its primary goal is to identify pain points within these interactions and design improved experiences that address those challenges.
The central theme of the project is “Balance”, interpreted through either human-product/service interactions or interactions between people mediated by design. After exploring a range of contexts, 
I chose to focus on the common interaction of using a smartphone while walking, a behavior many of us engage in daily.

					<p class="text"> Philosophy explored the dualism between mind and body. The Cartesian split theory shows 
						us that the mind can be considered the software that runs on the body, which is the hardware 
						(The mind explains behaviour while the body is the output device). Mind and body should be 
						perfectly balanced to consent us to move and act optimally in the environment but sometimes 
						this is not the case. 
						Nowadays with the use of technological devices, in particular, smartphones we tend to live in 
						two different dimensions, our minds, and thoughts are not aligned with our actions. We receive 
						dozens and dozens of messages, calls, e-mails, pictures, and much more. We are constantly 
						and instantly connected with people around us or even around the world. But often we lose 
						connection with the environment and with what is happening around us
 					</p>	
					<img src="risorse/balance.png" class="research-image_balance">
					
					<p class="text"> In this project, I applied and develop research and design skills iteratively. My aim was to 
						design and improve the current interactions explained in the Concept and to experience and 
						express the value of research in shaping and pursuing this aim. I developed my own. 
						design-minded research style and a research-minded design style. The insights achieved during 
						the research and design activities enabled me to develop a combined design and research 
						approach where the insights help my design and vice versa. I applied different types of design 
						and research methods, i.e., explorative, generative, and evaluative methods. Through the test and 
						evaluation of both low and high-fi prototypes, I evaluated my concept idea and defined the final 
						direction for the project.

					<p class="text">  There are similarities in the experience of blind people & people that use their phone. The peripherical view gives information about the surrounding environment. The awareness of the world around depends on the commitment required by the task on the phone. 
						The position of the phone is always aligned with the tip toes even when moving in a zigzag manner. 
						When using the phone many aspects and details of the context are missed.

					<p class="text"> Phone users tend to follow and trust the guide of the person in front of them.
						When using the phone, the path plotted is inconsistent and unpredictable.

						interactive live response to user actions made testing with users not only possible but also capable of yielding 
						valuable results. The prototype to make it compressible was made of silicone, and the LED light worked 
						through an interactive electric circuit inserted inside the silicone. The whole shape was then covered with a 
						fabric lining to give the feeling of a finished product</p>

				<div class="exhibition-details1">
					<p class="text">The prototype helped to rebalance the current interaction in which in most cases the phone users are really 
						focused on the screen and lose control and awareness of the surrounding environment. At the same time, 
						the other pedestrians (without the phone) feel frustrated due to the inability of catching other intentions. 
						The concept can be judged successful considering the evaluations’ results and the experiences shared by 
						the participants. In view of this, the qualities of the interaction vision are successfully fulfilled by the design 
						properties.</p>

					<img src="risorse/finalinsights_step.png" alt="exhibition section" class="exhibition-image">

					<p class="text">The active Interaction required by the users, by the device, makes them more aware of what is going on 
						around them and less focused on the phone.
						The user has the perception of being communicative towards the other pedestrians even 
						without having live feedback from the other pedestrians involved in the interaction.
						The shape reminds of a video game controller, this makes it perceived as playful and engaging. 
						The device makes the participants more conscious of their movements and the consequence was a more straight gait and a more consistent and steady pace.
						The product has the expected effect when it is known among the community with shared values and needs. In this sense product, contextualization is fundamental.
